// load that costs about 11 ms on a machine that is drawing. That is a repair,
// not a correction, and a predicting client needs the opposite: something small
// enough to send constantly.
//
// Sixteen karts of statekart_pak is 608 bytes against 318 KiB. A factor of five
// hundred is what makes a correction every few tics affordable at all: at one
// every four tics that is under 6 KB/s a client, where the same cadence with
// whole snapshots would be 2.8 MB/s. The arithmetic is why this packet carries
// kinematics and not a state dump.
//
// It is also the best instrument this branch has had for the drift it is
// chasing. Every correction is a measurement of the gap between one client and
// the server, on a named tic, for every kart -- continuously, instead of only
// when the consistency checksum trips and the resend cooldown allows it. So the

	// path; one kart counted down a sixty-four tic flash on the server that the
	// client never started.
	//
	// Both sides sample at the same point: the server stamps the tic it is about
	// to run, and the receiver holds the packet until its own clock reaches that

		skin - Skin number that the bot will use.
		difficulty - Difficulty level this bot will use.
		style - Bot style to spawn this bot with, see botStyle_e.
		newplayernum - Pointer to the last valid player slot number.
			Is a pointer so that this function can be called multiple times to add more than one bot.
