/// \brief Rollback netcode -- full world snapshot ring buffer (Phase 0)
///
/// Phase 0 of the rollback netcode plan: a ring buffer of complete world
/// snapshots, indexed by the tic they were taken before.
///
/// Both directions reuse the existing netgame archiver as-is. P_SaveNetGame
/// is pure serialisation. P_LoadNetGame takes a `reloading` flag which does
/// exactly what restoring a state within a level needs: the level is kept in
/// place instead of going back through P_LoadLevel, and the RNG seeds are
/// restored from the archive rather than reset. Upstream added that path for
/// mid-game gamestate reloads and says in P_NetUnArchiveMisc that it exists
/// with rollback in mind, so nothing in p_saveg needs changing here.
///
/// The matching `resending` flag on the save side is what puts gametic in the
/// archive; the two flags have to be set together or the reader desynchronises
/// from the writer by four bytes.
///
/// Snapshots are still written field by field through the P_NetArchive*
/// functions. Bulk memcpy of whole structs with manual pointer relinking is
/// faster and considerably more fragile; that trade is not worth making before
/// the timings below say it is needed.
///
/// This does not yet hook into the tic loop. It provides the snapshot
/// primitives plus a rollback_test console command that measures the
/// round-trip and verifies it byte for byte.

// Nominal snapshot size. NETSAVEGAMESIZE, which the netcode uses, is 768 KiB
// and sized for the worst a netgame savegame can be. Measured snapshots of a
// full sixteen-kart race come to 120 KiB, so the ring was reserving twenty
// megabytes to carry two and a half -- enough of the zone that an unrelated
// allocation failed and took the game down with "not enough memory for item
// roulette list".
//
// A quarter of that was still twice the largest snapshot then seen -- and it
// was not enough, because 120 KiB is what a race weighs seconds after the
// start. A soak run three minutes into the same race hit 318 KiB: the world
// accumulates objects as it is played, so a snapshot grows with the race. The
// guard caught it in the slack and said so, which is what the slack is for.
//
// Sized on that measurement rather than on the opening lap, with room for a
// race that goes further than the one measured.

// the slack instead of in the next slot, and is caught before anything else
// has been corrupted.

  * it compares equal while still being lost across a real rollback. Catching

  *
  * The perturbation is load-bearing rather than decorative: without it, a load
  * that silently did nothing at all would still compare equal. Disturbing the
  * RNG stream guarantees the state genuinely diverged before the restore,
  * since the seeds are part of the archive.
  *
  * One difference is expected rather than a defect: LUA_Archive walks Lua
  * tables with lua_next, whose order depends on the table's internal layout,
  * and unarchiving rebuilds those tables from scratch. On a map with Lua
  * ExtVars the two snapshots can disagree in the Lua archive for that reason
  * alone. It sits between the waypoints and RNG markers, so

//     it -- and none at all against one that does not: a stock server gets a

// after the fact, in a restore and a replay, and only when a prediction turns
// out wrong. The useful arrangement is a small fixed delay to absorb jitter
// cheaply, with rollback covering the rest up to a depth we are willing to pay
// for -- and past that depth, the delay has to rise again, because a rollback
// deeper than a frame's budget would cost more than it saves.

  * mutually exclusive by construction), so once the pivot took over that check
  * always came back false and the fixed delay kept charging for a round trip

  *
  * ⚠ The paragraph that used to sit here argued this was safe to call from

  * there node 0 is a person holding a controller. Measured before changing
  * anything (WORLDWIDE.md 8.24): rollbackpays read 0 on the host at every
  * print of a full race, so the host fell back to raw ping and charged itself
  * 6-7 tics of gentleman's delay -- 170-200 ms, the exact cost this branch
  * exists to remove -- while the remote client was charged none. The comment
  * checked the case where the answer did not matter and generalised to the
  * case where it did.
  *
  * The delay's whole purpose is to equalise: without it a host has instant
  * input while remote players eat their ping. Once those remote players
  * predict, their input lag is already ~0, so keeping the host's handicap does
  * not equalise anything -- it inverts the asymmetry it was built to prevent.
  *
  * ⚠ Not settled by this, and worth saying plainly: a host exempted here has
  * an edge over any remote player who is *not* running Worldwide. That is the
  * same trade the client-side exemption already makes, and the honest fix is
  * the capability advertising already scoped on the roadmap, not this
  * predicate. (WORLDWIDE mode, 8.80, closes it for the mode: a server running
  * it refuses every client that has not declared itself WORLDWIDE.)
